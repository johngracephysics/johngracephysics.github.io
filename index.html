  <h1>Understand the ideas, and success is inevitable</h1>

  <p>
    I'm a quantum optics researcher who loves to teach and connect over ideas. I help students achieve success by strengthening their foundational understanding, building their intuition, and having them apply these to solve problems.
  </p>

  <h2>What I offer</h2>
  I offer in-person (Ottawa-based students) and online sessions (all students) to students at two different levels:
  <h3>High school general science</h3>
  <p>I graduated from the Ontario high school system with excellent grades in science and mathematics (>97%). 
    I am very familiar with this curriculum, having helped many students with it, and can teach chemistry, biology, physics, mathematics and programming. </p>
  <h3>University physics and mathematics</h3>
  <p>I graduated from McGill University's Honours Physics program in high standing (3.95/4.00 GPA) which covered a wide breadth of foundational and advanced topics in mathematics and physics. 
    Courses I can teach include, but are not limited to: Calculus I-IV, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Classical Mechanics, Electricity and Magnetism, Quantum Mechanics and Thermodynamics.</p>
  

  <h2>Get in touch</h2>
  <p>If interested, please reach out! I offer a free 15 minute consultation over zoom if you want to see if I'm the right fit. Just leave your name, email and message and I'll get back to you ASAP.</p>
