  <h1>Understand the ideas, and success is inevitable</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a quantum optics researcher from McGill University (BSc. Honours Physics) who loves to teach and connect over ideas. 
    I help students achieve success by strengthening their foundational understanding, building their intuition, and having them apply these to solve problems.

  <h2>What I offer</h2>
  <p>
    I offer two distinct tutoring services based on my experience.
  
    Undergraduate physics and math; and
    High school general science (physics, math, chemistry, biology and programming)
